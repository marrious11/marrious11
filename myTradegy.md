### My most painfull life situatuation
<u> My Academic Perfomances are dire </u>
> As of first semester 2020/2021 my academic graph began to drop progressively till date: 😞 what is happening?
> No matter how hard I pretend to have worked for each semester, my final results are always tragic 😭 `grace has left me perhaps`.
> I tried to trust the process and just try to stay consistent, but still my final results of the 2022/2023 first semmester were as aorst as you could ever have imagned.
<br> I need some help please 😟!

GPA down in all my first 5 semesters at the University 😟, I doubt if I will survive this.
