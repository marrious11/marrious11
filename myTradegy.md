### My most painfull life situatuation
######  My Academic Perfomances are dire <hr>
<p> I have always believed in academic success,but it turned out over the years that I was maybe 100% wrong. </p>

> As of first semester 2020/2021 my academic graph began to drop progressively till date: ðŸ˜ž what is happening?
> No matter how hard I pretend to have worked for each semester, my final results are always tragic ðŸ˜­ `grace has left me perhaps`.
> I tried to trust the process and just try to stay consistent, but still my final results of the 2022/2023 first semmester were as aorst as you could ever have imagned.
<br> I need some good amount of help please ðŸ˜Ÿ! <br> Reach me at [`sohmarrious@gmail.com`](mailto:sohmarrious@gmail.com).

GPA down in all my first 5 semesters at the University ðŸ˜Ÿ, I doubt if I will survive this.
