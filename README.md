## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I'm Mario, a Computer Science student at [UB](https://ubuea.cm). I believe in `Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results`

## My Projects
- [Honex](https://honex.com), an educational and mass agro-production of honey and healthy brevagies using computer science and mathematics.
- [Momark](https://momark.site), an online market, where you can buy any good from the comfort of your homes and get it delivered to you within few hours
- [Agentenacity](https://agentcalcul.com), an online game about computer science algo-principles. Still featuring...
- [ ] And see more projects on my Github profile!
###  Ongoing projects...
- Google Summer of Code (Gsoc) @GDG Buea. `from April 2023`
- [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/)  `from December 2022 to march 2023`
- [Momark](https://momark.site) `now running live`

## Courses I've Enrolled in at Harvard
Before joining UB, I was a student learning computer science at
[CS50, Harvard University](https://cs50.harvard.edu). While at Harvard, I [enrolled](https://submit.cs50.io/courses/) into the following courses.

- [CS50â€™s own OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)
- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/notes/0/)
- [Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)
- [Introduction to Programming with Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/scratch/2021/)

##### Suggested Final year project for University Grads
Here are just some of the past few yearsâ€™ final projects, randomly ordered!
- [Gallery of Final Projects](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/gallery/)

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software.
Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here is a guide on how to [Getting Started](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/project/) with your project
There you'l find  some questions that you should think about as you start:
